# Hugo Theme Olich

## Introduction

A hugo theme used on my personal blog site.

This hugo theme use [Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) like starting point with some personal customization that I wanted to add on my blog.

## Requirements

It's necessary to use **Hugo â‰¥ 0.78.0**.

Use Hugo Extended version (recommended) if you want to:

* Use the latest feature/fix from `main` branch
* Edit SCSS files
  
**Compiled CSS are updated once per release or then Hugo extended version is enabled.**

## Installation

Clone / Download this repository to `theme` folder, and edit your site config following `exampleSite/config.yaml`.

Check [Stack documentation](https://docs.stack.jimmycai.com/) and [theme repository](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) for more details.
