My name is Oleh _(friends call me Olich)_. <br>

🇮🇹 In 2010, at the age of 13, I moved to Italy where I've started studying computer science and dreaming of the future.<br>
📖 I love learning new stuff, programming backend services (with attention on software architecture, clean code, best practices) and automating things. <br>
🔭 Fascinated by distributed systems, blockchains and cloud developing for scalable applications.<br>
