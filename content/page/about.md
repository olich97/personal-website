My name is Oleh _(friends call me Olich)_. <br>
I'm from [Ukraine](https://goo.gl/maps/TNhdrpgGgsRaUbJy7), born in 1997. <br>
In 2010, at the age of 13, I moved to [Italy](https://goo.gl/maps/LjJxzanHLYo7A1TQA) where I've started studying computer science and dreaming of the future.<br>
I love learning new stuff, programming backend services (with attention on software architecture, clean code, best practices) and automating things.
On my free time, I'm interested in distributed systems, blockchains and cloud developing for scalable applications.
