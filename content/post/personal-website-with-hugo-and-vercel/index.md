It's been a while that I was wondering on how bad I am on communication and also my English skills need to be improved. In addiction, I always wanted to have a personal website, something cool you know? Something made by myself. <br>
So a few weeks ago I started building this website, that would be also my blog and where I would wrote my posts in English ðŸ™„. In this way, I hope to have fun and improve my communication and English skills by actually practicing them, while building something of my own.<br>
I'm not a fun of writing a CSS styles, so I needed something ready on that side in order to begin with, but at the same time something flexible, fast and easy to use. I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). <br>
In this post, I'm trying to explain how to set up a personal site or blog with Hugo for **free**, by creating a [continuous deployment workflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment) with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), deploying and hosting our site on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) platform.
